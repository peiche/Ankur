# Ankur Block Theme

Ankur is a WordPress block theme with support for color variations and custom patterns. It's named after a Sanskrit word which means "flower," imagery often used to depict a new beginning. At the same time, an anchor (because I love wordplay) symbolizes stability and confidence. With Ankur as the fully customizable starting point, whether as a brand new site or revamping an existing one, you can tell your story with clean typography and bold colors.

## Style Variants

Ankur comes bundled with multiple style variants: light, dark, and three nature-themed alternates. To apply one of these styles, open the new Site Editor and select the Styles icon at the top right of the toolbar. In the Styles sidebar, you'll be able to pick your theme's style from the "Other styles" option.
